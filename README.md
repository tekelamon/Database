# Database

A modification of the "Sorting and Searching" project done for CIS 202.
This project will use a dynamically allocated array of arrays, rather than a vector of objects.

File input will be taken, then sorting and searching functions can be used from the command line to output data.
Output can come in two forms as well: a .csv style list or a visual table.
